# UI/UX Front-End Candidate Project (Vue 3 + PrimeVue 3) — Feature Requests / Ideas

Focus on **great UX**, **clean code**, and component composition. No ordering flows.

> Suggested time: ~3–6 hours. You don't need to finish everything—prioritize and explain your choices.

## Goals
- Thoughtful UX for browsing/filtering/prioritizing ideas.
- Composition API + Pinia + PrimeVue 3.
- Realistic empty/loading/error states; accessibility and responsiveness.

## Your Tasks
1. **(REQUIRED) Complex multi‑section form – “Submit Idea”**
   - Build a **single, complex form** at `/submit` with several sections, rich inputs, and validations.
   - Sections (minimum):
     - **Idea Basics**: title, description, category, tags.
     - **Impact & Priority**: personas (multi-select), impact score (slider), expected reach (number), target date (calendar).
     - **Technical**: complexity (dropdown), dependencies (chips), repo URL, privacy (radio buttons).
     - **Contact & Meta**: requester name/email, notifications (switch), terms/consent (checkbox).
   - Requirements: inline + summary validation, clear error text, keyboard navigation, screen-reader labels, helper text, responsive layout, and **Save Draft** to `localStorage`.

2. **Ideas workspace**
   - Enhance the Ideas list (sorting, filtering, pagination, column show/hide).
   - Search across title/description/tags; multi-filter bar (category, status, tags).
   - Create/Edit/Delete ideas (modal or inline).
   - Upvoting UX with immediate feedback, prevent accidental double votes.

3. **Dashboard**
   - KPIs (total, by status, most-voted, new this month) and a small Chart.js graph.

4. **Theme & Style Guide**
   - Light/Dark theme (PrimeVue themes), keyboard + SR support.
   - Style Guide page to illustrate your visual system.
