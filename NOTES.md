Notes:
 - after cursor helped with the submit form, had to go back to manully resolve ui issues like stacked icons and missing text for drop down (showed without a label - can be confusing what it does)
 - inconvienant but i had to remove the option to select all for the 'target personas' - reason is i did not find an easy way to add the label and due to the time constriant i decided to just reomve it for now so i dont waste time. 
- looked into the calendar component docs and added showButtonBar to be able to clear date added. disabled manual input for better error avoidance.
